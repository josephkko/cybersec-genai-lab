## Project Summary
This project explores how quantum-enhanced graph optimization and dynamic trust modeling can improve the safety and efficiency of multi-agent coordination in robotics systems that rely on digital twins.  

Real-time digital twins mirror physical robots and environments but introduce new cybersecurity risks such as sensor spoofing, message tampering, and desynchronization attacks. Our goal is to build an AI-enhanced, trust-aware system that detects and responds to such attacks, ensuring safe collaboration between humans and robot teams in dynamic environments.

We are integrating models such as TIP (Trust Inference and Propagation) and ECT (Expectation Confirmation Trust) into a live knowledge graph, and using quantum optimization (QAOA) to guide trust-aware task allocation decisions. Our testbed simulates ROS-based multi-robot systems and evaluates system resilience under attack.

## Tools and Models Used
- **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**  
- **TIP Model** (Trust Inference and Propagation Model)  
- **ECT Model** (Expectation Confirmation Trust Model)  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (for auxiliary text models or graph neural networks, if used)  
- **ROS / Gazebo** (for robot twin simulation)  
- **NetworkX** (for knowledge graph representation and updates)  
- **Python** for overall system orchestration
